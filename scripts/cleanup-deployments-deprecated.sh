# Vercel Deployment Cleanup Script (Shell Version)
# 
# This script removes old, inactive deployments from your Vercel project.
# It keeps the latest production deployment and a few recent preview deployments.

# Usage:
#   ./scripts/cleanup-deployments.sh [options]

# Options:
#   --dry-run    Show what would be deleted without actually deleting
#   --keep N     Number of deployments to keep (default: 5)
#   --project    Vercel project name (default: agent-bio-summary-v2)
