# 1. Set your Vercel Personal Access Token as an environment variable.

#    
#    Option 1: Export in your shell:
#      export VERCEL_TOKEN="your_token"

#    Option 2: Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
#      export VERCEL_TOKEN="your_token"
#    
#    Option 3: Create a .env file (ignored by git):
#      VERCEL_TOKEN=your_token
#      Then run: source .env && ./scripts/cleanup-deployments.sh

#    Your project name is 'agent-bio-summary-v2'.
