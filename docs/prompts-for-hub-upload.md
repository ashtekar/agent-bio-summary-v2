   - Takes: query, maxResults, dateRange, sources
   - Returns: Count of articles found
   - State: Stores search results for next tool

2. extractScoreAndStoreArticles: Processes search results (extract content, score relevancy, store in DB)
   - Takes: relevancyThreshold (reads search results from state automatically)
   - Returns: List of relevant articles that passed the threshold
   - State: Stores processed articles for summarization

3. summarizeArticle: Generates summaries for ALL stored articles

   - State: Stores collated summary for email

5. sendEmail: Sends newsletter to recipients
   - Takes: summary, recipients, metadata
   - Returns: Delivery confirmation

YOUR TASK:
Generate a daily synthetic biology newsletter by:
1. Finding recent articles on synthetic biology and biotechnology
2. Filtering for relevant, high-quality articles
3. Creating comprehensive summaries (minimum 100 words per article)
4. Collating into a cohesive HTML email newsletter
5. Sending to all specified recipients

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Tools read from shared state automatically - don't pass data between tools manually
