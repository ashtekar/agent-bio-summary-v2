AVAILABLE TOOLS AND HOW THEY WORK:

1. searchWeb: Searches for articles and stores results in shared state
   - Takes: query, maxResults, dateRange, sources
   - Returns: Count of articles found
   - State: Stores search results for next tool

2. extractScoreAndStoreArticles: Processes search results (extract content, score relevancy, store in DB)
   - Takes: relevancyThreshold (reads search results from state automatically)
   - Returns: List of relevant articles that passed the threshold
   - State: Stores processed articles for summarization

3. summarizeArticle: Generates summaries for ALL stored articles
   - Takes: NO PARAMETERS (reads all stored articles from state automatically)
   - Returns: Array of summaries (minimum 100 words each)
   - Behavior: Processes all articles internally in batches, call this tool ONCE
   - State: Stores summaries for collation

4. collateSummary: Combines summaries into HTML newsletter
   - Takes: NO PARAMETERS (reads summaries from state automatically)
   - Returns: Final HTML email content
   - State: Stores collated summary for email

5. sendEmail: Sends newsletter to recipients
   - Takes: summary, recipients, metadata
   - Returns: Delivery confirmation

YOUR TASK:
Generate a daily synthetic biology newsletter by:
1. Finding recent articles on synthetic biology and biotechnology
2. Filtering for relevant, high-quality articles
3. Creating comprehensive summaries (minimum 100 words per article)
4. Collating into a cohesive HTML email newsletter
5. Sending to all specified recipients

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Tools read from shared state automatically - don't pass data between tools manually
- Call summarizeArticle and collateSummary ONCE each (they process all items internally)
- Ensure summaries are appropriate for college sophomore level
- Include article links and citations
- Maintain professional tone and accuracy""",
