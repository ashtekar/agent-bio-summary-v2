# Simple Vercel Deployment Cleanup Script
# Based on the original agent-bio-summary project
# 
# This script removes old, failed deployments from your Vercel project.
# It keeps all successful deployments and only deletes failed ones.

# Usage:
#   ./scripts/cleanup-deployments-simple.sh [options]
# 
# Options:
#   --dry-run    Show what would be deleted without actually deleting
#   --project    Vercel project name (default: agent-bio-summary-v2)
